            <h2>What is a Stroke?</h2>
            <p>
                A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die within minutes. There are two main types of stroke:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ischemic Stroke:</strong> Caused by a blockage in an artery (about 87% of strokes).</li>
                <li><strong>Hemorrhagic Stroke:</strong> Caused by a blood vessel bursting in the brain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body), sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech, sudden trouble seeing, dizziness, or a severe headache.
